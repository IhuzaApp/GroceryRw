# Route Protection Implementation Summary

## ✅ **All Pages Protected Successfully**

### **Plasa Pages (Shopper-Only Access)**
All Plasa pages now require authentication and shopper role:

1. **`/pages/Plasa/active-batches/index.tsx`** ✅
   - Protected with `withRouteProtection(ActiveBatchesPage, { requireAuth: true, requireRole: 'shopper' })`

2. **`/pages/Plasa/active-batches/batch/[id]/index.tsx`** ✅
   - Protected with `withRouteProtection(BatchDetailsPage, { requireAuth: true, requireRole: 'shopper' })`

3. **`/pages/Plasa/chat/[orderId].tsx`** ✅
   - Protected with `withRouteProtection(ChatPage, { requireAuth: true, requireRole: 'shopper' })`

4. **`/pages/Plasa/Earnings/index.tsx`** ✅
   - Protected with `withRouteProtection(EarningsPage, { requireAuth: true, requireRole: 'shopper' })`

5. **`/pages/Plasa/invoices/index.tsx`** ✅
   - Protected with `withRouteProtection(InvoicesPage, { requireAuth: true, requireRole: 'shopper' })`

6. **`/pages/Plasa/invoices/[id]/index.tsx`** ✅
   - Protected with `withRouteProtection(InvoicePage, { requireAuth: true, requireRole: 'shopper' })`

7. **`/pages/Plasa/orders/[id].tsx`** ✅

8. **`/pages/Plasa/Settings/index.tsx`** ✅
   - Protected with `withRouteProtection(SettingsPage, { requireAuth: true, requireRole: 'shopper' })`

9. **`/pages/Plasa/ShopperProfile/index.tsx`** ✅
   - Protected with `withRouteProtection(ShopperProfilePage, { requireAuth: true, requireRole: 'shopper' })`

### **User Pages (Authentication Required)**
All user pages now require authentication:

1. **`/pages/CurrentPendingOrders/index.tsx`** ✅
   - Protected with `withRouteProtection(CurrentOrdersPage, { requireAuth: true })`

2. **`/pages/CurrentPendingOrders/viewOrderDetails/[orderId].tsx`** ✅
   - Protected with `withRouteProtection(ViewOrderDetailsPage, { requireAuth: true })`

3. **`/pages/Messages/index.tsx`** ✅
   - Protected with `withRouteProtection(MessagesPage, { requireAuth: true })`

4. **`/pages/Messages/[orderId].tsx`** ✅
   - Protected with `withRouteProtection(ChatPage, { requireAuth: true })`

5. **`/pages/Recipes/index.tsx`** ✅
   - Protected with `withRouteProtection(RecipesPage, { requireAuth: true })`

6. **`/pages/Recipes/[id].tsx`** ✅
   - Protected with `withRouteProtection(RecipeDetailPage, { requireAuth: true })`

7. **`/pages/restaurant/[id].tsx`** ✅
   - Protected with `withRouteProtection(RestaurantPage, { requireAuth: true })`

8. **`/pages/Myprofile/index.tsx`** ✅ (Previously protected)
   - Protected with `withRouteProtection(MyProfilePage, { requireAuth: true })`

### **Cart Page (Conditional Access)**
- **`/pages/Cart/index.tsx`** ✅ (Previously protected)
  - Uses `ProtectedCart` component for checkout actions
  - Can be viewed by guests but requires auth for actions

## **Route Access Summary**

### **Public Routes (No Authentication Required)**
- `/` - Home page
- `/Reels` - Reels page
- `/shops` - Shops listing
- `/shops/[id]` - Individual shop pages
- `/Auth/Login` - Login page
- `/Auth/Register` - Registration page

### **Conditional Routes (Guest View Allowed, Auth Required for Actions)**
- `/Cart` - Can view cart but need auth to add items or checkout

### **Protected Routes (Authentication Required)**
- `/Myprofile` - User profile
- `/Messages` - Messages
- `/CurrentPendingOrders` - Current orders
- `/Recipes` - Recipes
- `/restaurant` - Restaurant pages

### **Shopper-Only Routes (Shopper Role Required)**
- `/Plasa/*` - All Plasa pages (shopper dashboard)

## **Implementation Details**

### **Protection Method**
All pages use the `withRouteProtection` Higher-Order Component (HOC) which:
- Checks authentication status
- Verifies user role when required
- Redirects unauthorized users to login
- Shows loading state during authentication check

### **Protection Levels**
1. **`requireAuth: true`** - Requires user to be signed in
2. **`requireRole: 'shopper'`** - Requires shopper role (in addition to auth)

### **User Experience**
- **Guest Users**: Can access public pages, redirected to login for protected pages
- **Signed-in Customers**: Can access all customer pages, redirected to home for Plasa pages
- **Signed-in Shoppers**: Can access all pages including Plasa dashboard

## **Files Modified**

### **New Files Created**
- `src/context/RouteProtectionContext.tsx` - Main protection context
- `src/components/auth/ProtectedCart.tsx` - Cart protection component
- `src/components/auth/ProtectedShopAction.tsx` - Shop action protection
- `ROUTE_PROTECTION_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `PROTECTION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

### **Files Updated**
- `middleware.ts` - Enhanced route protection
- `pages/_app.tsx` - Added RouteProtectionProvider
- All Plasa pages (9 files) - Added shopper protection
- All user pages (8 files) - Added authentication protection
- Cart page - Added action protection

## **Testing Recommendations**

1. **Test as Guest User**:
   - Visit public pages (should work)
   - Try to access protected pages (should redirect to login)
   - Try to add items to cart (should show auth prompt)

2. **Test as Customer**:
   - Access customer pages (should work)
   - Try to access Plasa pages (should redirect to home)
   - Perform cart actions (should work)

3. **Test as Shopper**:
   - Access all pages including Plasa (should work)
   - Switch between roles (should work with proper redirects)

## **Status: ✅ COMPLETE**

All requested pages have been successfully protected according to the requirements:
- ✅ All Plasa pages protected (shopper-only)
- ✅ All user pages protected (authentication required)
- ✅ Cart page has conditional access
- ✅ Public pages remain accessible to guests
- ✅ Proper redirects and user experience implemented
